<div class="codebox"><b>4.10.2008 - Parsifal XML Parser 1.1 release</b></div>
<br>

<p>Added XMLFLAG_USE_SIMPLEPULL for progressive parsing  and xmlreader.c that implements pull parser.
Included contributions made by other people: libparsifal-config, pns.h for global namespace handling.
Thanks to all who contributed! Lots of improvements for portability; xmlhash improvements also 
improve performance. Added better uri handling for xmlplint - see uriresolver.h for details. Lot
of minor bug fixes. See also changelog.

<p>Docbook document (mapped to docbook 4.5 via catalogs) <a href="http://www.saunalahti.fi/~samiuus/toni/xmlproc/parsifal_tests/modular_tests/pyGtk-GettingStarted.xml">
pyGtk-GettingStarted.xml</a> gets
parsed and validated in 140 ms with pentium M740 CPU. (I think w/o catalogs ms number would be even lower). That's pretty fast considering Parsifal validation is now also very conformant to xml specification -
latest addition being validation of ID/IDREF(S) and other TokenizedType attributes. Here is <a href="docbook.txt">SAX event output</a> of
it. Some statistics (docbook 4.5): elementDecls 406, attributeDecls 7567, entityDecls 3238<br>

<div class="codebox"><b>30.1.2005 - Validation support</b></div>
<br>

<p>
A sort of milestone. Still needs some tweaking and hard testing. Next stop is RelaxNG module?!
</p>

<br>
<div class="codebox"><b>11.8.2004 - Optimizations and portability improvements</b></div>
<br>

<p>
New release introduces several optimizations (see ChangeLog). Portability has also been improved by making
some changes mostly in xmlcfg.h. Infact PalmOS port should be on its way - I've been in touch with
a guy who's working on this. More about this soon.
</p>

<br>
<div class="codebox"><b>5.6.2004 - It should be mentioned...</b></div>
<br>

<p>
that although parsifal doesn't yet pass the oasis xml testsuite with 100 % conformance, the most of remaining/failing about 50 of
1811 tests aren't critical for using XML 1.0 features - you can use them all! Also note that there are a few tests that fail
because of namespace support or because the test parser used libiconv and thus reports PASS with japanese encodings etc.
</p>

<br>
<div class="codebox"><b>1.6.2004 - Towards full XML conformance</b></div>
<br>

<p>
New release 0.8.0 adds support for DTD processing; declaration handlers, default attribute processing
and parameter entities etc. Parser stays quite lightweight despite of all these new features!
</p>

<br>
<div class="codebox"><b>9.3.2004 - Optimization thoughts</b></div>
<br>

<p>
I ran Parsifal 0.7.4 on MSVC++ profiler with test.rdf (11 MB attribute oriented document) some time ago. Function timing results are <a href="profilerrun1.txt">here</a>.
Ignore modules <code>profiler.obj</code> and <code>bench.obj</code> when checking the results.
</p>
<p>
Inlining <code>ReadCh</code> (with <code>__inline</code>) improves the performance most but as there's total 24 occurrences
of ReadCh calls, this makes executable about 4 KB bigger! Making separate version of inlined ReadCh for critical points could be
an option in this case. Besides inlining ReadCh making new version of XMLStringbuf_Append inside <code>parsifal.c</code> and _forceinline'ing it improves
total performance from about 0.88 sec to 0.72 sec. (DLL executable size grows from 80KB to 88KB). I didn't yet make any calling convention tests or changes - don't know if they'll
be worth all the #ifdefs and all that hassle.
</p>
<p>
Some optimizations via conditional compilation will be available in the next release.
